AI Prototyping V3 Refinement




Goal: To elevate the AI Prototyping course from a foundational course to an advanced, technical certification that empowers Senior Product Managers to build, debug, and deploy high-fidelity prototypes with 10x professional velocity and build a truly advanced prototype.
Objective: Synthesize multi-cohort feedback to remove redundant introductory content, increase the complexity of hands-on labs, and provide "from-the-field" strategic frameworks that ensure every student and group has a sophisticated, functional prototype ready for final evaluation.

Modules to Change
Module 1: Accelerate the Idea-to-Validation Cycle
Deck to adjust: ​​Copy of M1: Accelerate the Idea-to-Validation Cycle
Lab guide to adjust: Copy of AI Prototyping M1: Lab Guide and Walkthrough
Student Survey Results: Module 1
Strategic Goal: Move beyond "introductory" concepts to secure senior-level buy-in immediately.
* Content Depth & Velocity: The first half contains repetition regarding the general usefulness of AI (time-saving, shared context). Senior PMs want to skip straight to the "new operating model" and build faster. 

* The "Aha" Moment: The module lacks a strong opening demo. Auditors suggest the instructor perform a live, high-speed build of an impressive clickable prototype to show "what is possible now vs. weeks of work". → This was tried but the instructor’s demo was not exciting enough and too much time was spent here. The demo should be final project related to show the possible capabilities or your own, exciting product you vibe-coded and prototyped yourself.

* Lab Rigor & Technical Logistics: Many students hit "token limits" on Lovable almost immediately, preventing them from finishing the second half of the lab. → We must be explicit before the course starts via Slack that we strongly suggest that students get Lovable Pro. For the actual group builds, at least one member of each team MUST have an account.[a]

* Field Authenticity: Students want to see the instructor's personal POV and real-world examples of how they use these tools in a professional leadership capacity.

Module 2: Write Advanced Prompts for High-Fidelity Prototypes
Deck to adjust: Copy of M2: Write Advanced Prompts for High-Fidelity Prototypes
Lab guide to adjust: Copy of AI Prototyping M2: Lab Guide and Walkthrough
Student Survey Results: Module 2        
Strategic Goal: Shift from "basic prompting" to "precision architecting".
   * Content Depth: The current version is perceived as "too basic" for an advanced course. Spending time on foundational concepts like the difference between System and User prompts or token windows is seen as a waste of time for this audience. → This was something the instructor did as extra and there is no content about token windows in the slides. 

   * Lab Complexity: The 20-minute window for the final exercise was insufficient. Students found the "guessing exercise" low-value and preferred more live, "pro" prompt modifications performed by the instructor.

   * Technical Rigor: Students want to see "Cutting-Edge" techniques—like Self-Consistency and Chain of Thought—applied to complex UI/UX options rather than simple text prompts.

   * Strategic Application: There is a request to show how to use ChatGPT to fulfill the FUDI framework quickly to save time on drafting and focus more on "strategizing on prototype improvements".

Module 3: Define the Modern Specs for Prototype Development
Deck to adjust: Copy of M3: Define the Modern Specs for Prototype Development
Lab guide to adjust:Copy of AI Prototyping M3: Lab Guide and Walkthrough
Student Survey Results: Module 3
Strategic Goal: Align requirements with professional product management standards.
      * Content Depth: Experienced PMs felt this module lacked a "strategic mindset for existing products". They want to know how to prototype within an existing portfolio, not just a "0-to-1" startup idea.

      * Terminology & Logic: The concept of "Simplified PRD" vs. "PRO" caused confusion. Auditors suggest positioning the PRD as a "living document" that iterates alongside the prototype.

      * Field Authenticity: Students requested more "from the field" examples, such as how PM teams organize themselves around prototyping and how interactions with dev teams actually change.

      * Lab Flow: The volume of links, docs, and templates shared in the first hour was described as "messy" and "overwhelming". The lab instructions need to be a more straightforward, "step-by-step manual" to avoid group confusion.

Module 4: Build, Iterate, and Debug Prototypes End-to-End
Deck to adjust:Copy of M4: Build, Iterate, and Debug Prototypes End-to-End
Lab guide to adjust: Copy of AI Prototyping M4: Lab Guide and Walkthrough
Student Survey Results: Module 4
Strategic Goal: Transition from "AI-built" to "PM-directed" precision.
         * Content Depth & Energy: The second half of the session moved too slowly. Auditors noted that an hour into the class, students still hadn't started building, leading to lower energy. → this was again an instructor issue moving too slow and not managing time. 

         * Technical Rigor: There is a significant gap in "advanced debugging". Students want to know when to dive into actual code, the benefit of doing so to save credits, and how to use other LLMs (like Claude) to fix hallucinations.

         * Mode Optimization: The instructor did not sufficiently cover "Chat Mode" vs. "Agent Mode," which is a critical distinction for advanced tool usage.

         * Lab Autonomy: Students felt frustrated by "watching" the instructor build in AIQ rather than being hands-on. There was significant confusion in the exercises regarding whether to use the "FUDI" framework or the "Prompt Pack" at specific stages. → Again this was due to the instructor’s choice of teaching. Students should be building themselves, rather than watching.

	Please continue to push the hands-on exercises to engage students and keep the discussion lively. This course we better in terms of frequent hands-on activities but still has a fair amount of "sit and get". The instructor was knowledgeable but not a great facilitator, if you can't find teachers with engaging delivery and hands-on experience, go the for the former and give them the talking points/examples.

	I think it would be fun if in the future you had a prototype competition, where teams presented prototypes solving a specific business problem and the teacher chose the feature they would approve and push through to engineering. In other words, the students were working to solve the same business problem -- but not necessarily working to prototype the same feature.

	The time period for the class should be longer than 12 hours. Part of the pre-class assignment should include reference to tutorials for the technology as well as best practices to minimize credit usage. Or upfront acknowledgement that as subscription would be needed.  The class should be more than the 12 hours, have have a day of lectures followed by presentations means that the last day of content because independent study if it has to be represented in the presentation.

	The automated and quick responses for any and all questions are robotic. There are pleasantries but little actual action or honest intake of our feedback (or so it seems). The blast of emails, reminders, slack posts and other communications MUST indidate the course FULL name and the instructor name. The abbreviations are space-saving but when one is signed up for many courses, it helps to quickly know which one you are talking about. With the utter chaos or class cancelling and instructors dropping off, we need to know which course you are talking about. Currently, we maintain a spreadsheet with course name, corresponding instructor, day-time of classes, course's abbreviation, etc. Not adding course's full name is sloppy house keeping. This is not done in US and Canada but may be practiced in Spain.
